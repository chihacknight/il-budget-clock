    <p class="h2">On June 30, 2016 5:18pm a temporary budget was passed.</p>
    
    <p>Governor Rauner’s office announced he’s signed a temporary, patchwork-of-a-budget into law.  It’s 11 months, 30 days, 17 hours, 18 minutes late.</p>

    <p>At midnight July 1st, it would have been one year. Maybe Gov. Rauner and Democratic leadership in the legislature just didn’t want to face those headlines in the morning. Whatever the sudden source of urgency after so many months—here’s to hoping this will bring some relief to those who have been suffering through this game of chicken.</p>

    <p>Here’s the thing, y’all. Yes, K-12 education is funded for a year. And you’ll be happy to know state legislators will likely be paid. But social services are still only 65% funded through the end of the year. What will fall into the 45% gulf?</p>

    <p>And what will happen at the end of the year? What can we expect for funding the rest of 2017, and then 2018? Is this just how Illinois State government will (not) function, from now on?</p>

    <p>With the budget punted until after the Nov 8 election, state legislators will now take this problem on the campaign trail. Let’s make sure they know we’ll be thinking of that other 45% in the voting booth.</p>
