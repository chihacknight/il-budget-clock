# il-budget-clock
Counting up the days and consequences Illinois goes without a budget. It would be like the number of days without a budget in huge letters, and then links below as to what it’s effects and context are (perhaps a curated list of news articles)

##Goals: 
 - Call attention to how long this impasse has gone on
 - Inspire citizens to demand action
 - Explain the background
 - Illustrate the impact on services
 - Inspire stopgap support for impacted providers

##Example/potential features
 - Clock showing days without an IL budget
 - Explainers
 - List of affected organizations, descriptions of impact, buttons to donate
 - autodial your representatives
